- Use Python 3.9+ for all backend logic.
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for all Python code (linting enforced).
- Include all necessary imports/dependencies and use clear, conventional naming appropriate for the project's language.
- Minimize extraneous prose in code comments; focus on functional explanations.
- Prefer standard library modules where feasible before introducing third-party dependencies.
- When generating code, prioritize readability and maintainability.
- Ensure all file paths are handled securely and cross-platform compatible (e.g., using os.path.join).
- Implement robust error handling and logging throughout the application.
- Follow Flask best practices for web application security.
- Use secure filename handling for uploaded files.
- Validate file extensions and implement upload size limits.
